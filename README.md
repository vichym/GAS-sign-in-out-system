# GAS-sign-in-out-system

## From Author: 
I created this project in Google App Script for my high school, UWC ISAK Japan, during my senior year to replace pen-and-paper sign in-out
system. This was my first coding project ever. The code connects Google Spreadsheet, Google Form, and Gmail to create a system which allow end-users (ISAK students) to sign in/out
using google form.

## Features : 

- Auto-generates data: about people who sign out on “Sign Out Students” sheet;
- One email, one name : students can only sign in/out for themselves using their email;
- Reminder Emailing  : auto-generated email will be sent to those who is  1 hours late and still have not signed in. 
- Overnight Trip Permission Check. 
- Banning students from signing out
